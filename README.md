# DonoBook — P2P Book Exchange & Donation Platform

DonoBook is a full-stack Progressive Web App (PWA) built to help students share, exchange, and donate books within their local or academic communities. The goal of the platform is simple: make educational resources easier to access while reducing waste.

The project is built using React (TypeScript) on the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and integrates Google Gemini for basic AI-powered book data extraction.

## Key Features

### 📚 Smart Book Upload

Users can upload photos of book covers, and the system automatically extracts useful details like title, author, and category using Google Gemini. It works well even with local Pakistani textbooks.

### 💬 Real-Time Chat

DonoBook includes a built-in messaging system where users can talk directly to each other for exchanges or donations. Messages are updated instantly using Supabase Realtime.

### 🔔 Push Notifications

Users receive notifications for new messages and activity even when the app is closed. This is handled through Firebase Cloud Messaging and a serverless function.

### 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA)

The app can be installed on both mobile and desktop like a native app. It also supports background notifications through a service worker.

### 🔐 Authentication & Security

User authentication is managed by Supabase (email/password and Google login). Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access their own data.
